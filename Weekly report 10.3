Hi Omar, 

I wanted to provide a weekly report on my progress this past week. This past week I: 

- Completed sections 1/2 of FSR/ICD
- Completed the Validation/Execution plan for the project
- Currently building off of current backend code in order to get email notifications as well as online data storage set up from the code.  

Best regards,
Amrit Nanda
