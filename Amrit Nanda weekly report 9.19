I wanted to provide my weekly report. This week I focused on:

- Completing our first two sections in ConOps (Executive summary / background / overview)
- Created a list of logistical questions for our sponsor to ask regarding FSR document completion / subsystem clarifications
- Started researching how sensors (temperature, pressure, current, voltage, etc) can receive / store data and how I can use Java in conjunction with app development software to advance the project. 
- Researched java coding techniques for data collection 

Please let me know if I can provide any additional information,

Best regards,
