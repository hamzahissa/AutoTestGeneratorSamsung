- this last weekend, I finished the PCB layout, and I plan on meeting with Dr. Lusher for a quick review and to answer questions about getting it sent to fabrication.

- in lab, I partially validated our water level sensor by making sure it outputted the right voltage for 0% water level. In lab I also researched for a water tank for our simulation environment, and got the order sent in.

- this week, I will ask Dr. Lusher final questions about our PCB and get it sent in to be fabricated.
