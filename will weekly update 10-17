- finished schematic, but after talking to lusher, added a few more things

- layout is 15-20% done. Hoping to be done before our presentation next Monday but worst case scenario, it will be sent to fab by the end of that week.

- tested 1 of our 2 analog sensors today for functionality. The other sensor arrived today and will test soon
