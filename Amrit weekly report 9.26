Amrit Nanda weekly report 9/26

I wanted to provide my weekly report. This past week I:

- Started on the backend code for the project, which involves creating the generator input and parsing in values for pressure, temperature, and fuel level. 
- Worked on Sections 1/2 of FSR, Sections 1/2 of ICD, created 2 block diagrams, and completed the Gant chart and the validation plan. 

Best regards,
Amrit Nanda
